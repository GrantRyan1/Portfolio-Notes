HIBERNATE
  From my studies, I have understood that hibernate is used to be able to work and modify a database. Using hibernate to develop
  your database can make it easier to manage web based applications, which we are doing. Hibernate will map java objects, classes, 
  and types to database tables for us. That is a basic overview of what it does, there was a lot more that I will be studying.
  
  Here is the link to my git and code that for some different examples:

JUNIT Tests
    While looking at Junit testing, it became very clear of what their purpose was for. They are written so you can test the code
    that you have written. The are set up to fail so you have to change your parameters if you have Eclipse do most of the writing,
    but that can easily be helped. Several tests are written so that you can figure out what parts of the program is failing and 
    where there might be holes in what is written.
    
    Here is a link to my example code for Junit Testing:

HTTP URL Connection
    These technologies are use to be able to make connections. They help to read and write to servers and conenct to webpages. This
    is useful since we are writing a web application.
