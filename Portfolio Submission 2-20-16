    JSON Serialization
    
      This week I studied some JSON. I actually determined that it's a pretty useful tool for developing. From my understanding,
      you can use it for a variety of reasons. I studied how you can use it to store data on a server, how it's similar to JavaScript,
      and how it's nice to use because it's self-describing meaning it's really easy for us to read.
