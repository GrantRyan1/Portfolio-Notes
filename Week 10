  Week 10 Portfolio
  
  This last week I focused on upgrading my Application Controller Portfolio and the remaining code topics I had left.
  
  Application Controller Pattern
    Here is the link to my code example:
      https://github.com/GrantRyan1/JAVA-2/blob/master/ApplicationController
      
      
  Threads/Executors/Runnables/Handlers
    Here is the link to my code examples:
      https://github.com/GrantRyan1/JAVA-2/blob/master/Executors
        https://github.com/GrantRyan1/JAVA-2/blob/master/ThreadsAndRunnables
          
          
  Here also is a link to our group application that we are working on and will be presenting on this next week. 
    It uses topics such as connecting sockets to the server and handling requests from the client/server by the AppControler.
    It also shows threads, runnables, and a JSONObject we will be creating to send data back and forth about the FlashCards.
