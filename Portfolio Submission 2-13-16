Socket I/O
  Sockets, from my understanding are where the data is sent too and where it comes from. Without a socket destination, there wouldn't be 
  any place to send the data too. The socket i/o principle seems to be used a lot when developing chat applications. My team has 
  talked a lot about that in recent presentations. 
  One of the things that I have understood with Socket I/O is that there is a client and a server. The client often requests data and
  the server can respond to that request and send data back to it. It also can work visa-versa, with the server requesting data and the
  client will respond with necessary data. But most often, the server is the listener of the two.
 
Here is some example code used for socket i/o to be used in my application application:
