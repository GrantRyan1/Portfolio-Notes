    Use Case Documents
      Use cases are basically just business goals. They diagram or explain what the end user is going to do and how
      it is going to intereact with the system. Thee document doesn't necessarily explain all the intrinsic details of 
      the use case or go into a lot of details about the system or its requirements. It is more of a general overview of 
      of the problem or concern and uses a user story to illustrate that.

    Use Case Diagram
      The Use Case Diagram uses actors,associations, packages, system boundaries, and other tools to show actions of the actor 
      or user. The diagram gives an overview of the system and requirements for that system. Mostly they are used for presentations 
      and to give a simple example of how the system functions. They are mostly surface-leve and general in detail, but display
      what some refer to as the "meat" of the system and its requirements.
