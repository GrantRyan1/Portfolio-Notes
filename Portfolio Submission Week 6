    JSON Serialization
    
      This week I studied some JSON. I actually determined that it's a pretty useful tool for developing. From my understanding,
      you can use it for a variety of reasons. I studied how you can use it to store data on a server, how it's similar to JavaScript,
      and how it's nice to use because it's self-describing meaning it's really easy for us to read.

    Application Controller Pattern
      From my studies, it seems that this is a pattern that is used to control the views and the structure of an appliation. Moving 
      from page to page can be extremely difficult and writing the code an make it more complex if not impossible to figure out. This
      pattern allows for the developers to help transition from view to view. It also helps them to bring up certain pages, due to the logic 
      of them, and invoke them at different times when needed. From the book I also was abe to surmise that the Pattern allows for us to 
      invoke specific functions or classes, or methods that specifically are needed for our application. It gave an example that has the 
      Pattern being used to call a target that calls a handler for specific situations. This handler is used whenever another class needs 
      that task done.

   MVC 
      MVC is a framework we are using to build our web applications. The model stores the data. The view presents the data to the user
      based on the changes that were made to the model. The controller sends commands to the model to change the data or update the state
      of the model. For example, editing a document.
